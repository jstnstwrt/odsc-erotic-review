# odsc-erotic-review

The work in this repository initiated at the Open Data Science hackathon against Human Trafficing hosted in August 2015.
One can use this to scrape theeroticreview.com, a forum for buyers of prostitution (a john board), for user information.

Specifically, we pull the usernames from individuals who post on the forum, store this data in a sqlite database and create 
a selection of figures describing the frequency of use of the distribution of 'Johns'.
